# TicTacToe-game
A simple tictactoe game which stores the result of the last played game and displays it in an alert.

# How I started it
This was actually a task given to me when I applied to an internship, well whether I got into that internship or is a suspense shhh.

# Issues faced
So I had to make a leaderboard which stores the result of the previous game played but I couldnt exactly do it. All I managed to do is making an alert which shows the result :(
